# adventofcode
These JavaScript programs produce answers for the 50 puzzles in the 2017 Advent of Code (http://adventofcode.com/).
I'm using the AoC platform to provide me a steady streem of puzzles to help me cement my learning of JavaScript.
These are not elegant solutions, nor particularly beautiful to read. As of Day 4, comments are non-existent and structure is loose.
It's a sample of work that is of good enough for a one-off hacky script to get a job done.
Rather than go back and clean up code, I will work toward using better style as a move forward through the puzzles.
