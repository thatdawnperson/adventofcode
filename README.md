# adventofcode
These JavaScript programs produce answers for the 50 puzzles in the 2018 Advent of Code (http://adventofcode.com/).
Two puzzles are released each day from December 1 through December 25, with the second puzzle (and its solution) building on the first.
I'm using the AoC platform to exercise my R chops. Where I can't solve a problem in R, I will change language to either Python or Perl (haven't decided which yet).

It's a sample of work that is of good enough for a one-off hacky script to get a job done.
Rather than go back and clean up code, I will work toward using better style as I move forward through the puzzles.
